//! THE "GENERAL" SECTION OF THE HELP AND ITS TIE TO THE PROGRAM.
//!
//! Articles about tools are held by the `help_map_flow` guard: a command has a row in the table, a row
//! has a file. The cross-cutting articles — settings, hotkeys, the tree, the timeline — have no such
//! table and cannot have one: they describe not a command but the way things are built. So they will
//! rot even more quietly: a setting is added, a section renamed, a key introduced — and the article
//! goes on describing last year's program with nobody seeing it.
//!
//! Hence guards of a different kind here: they check the articles against THE VERY SOURCES the
//! interface itself is assembled from — the list of settings sections and the hotkey reference. Not
//! against a text saying how it ought to be, but against the code.
