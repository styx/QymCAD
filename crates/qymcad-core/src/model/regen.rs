//! Timeline rebuild: one pass that builds the model from the feature tree.
//!
//! `regenerate` lives here together with the helpers nothing else calls. The split is mechanical, by call
//! graph rather than by name, which makes this a closed unit: the module has exactly one entry point,
//! `regenerate`, and all the machinery of a single pass (re-pointing references at new bodies, face names from
//! recipes, the extent of a tool body, resolving a revolve axis) stays hidden.
//!
//! The rebuild is the most interconnected part of the core, and keeping it in a general file next to two
//! hundred unrelated methods means starting every edit by working out what here is even connected.
