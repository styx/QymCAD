//! THE COMBINATIONS EACH SYSTEM KEEPS - one table per system, holding every combination a binding is refused on
//! that system, so a new rule for one of them is a row in its table rather than a condition threaded through the
//! rebinding code.
//!
//! What a binding's modifiers are on each system:
//!
//! * "Ctrl" is the command key: Ctrl on Linux and Windows, Cmd on a Mac. One record means the same keys on every
//!   system, which is what lets one factory layout serve all three.
//! * "Control" is the Mac's own Control key, a modifier of its own there. Linux and Windows have no key that is
//!   not already "Ctrl", so a Control binding brought by a profile from a Mac does not run on them.
//!
//! What the tables hold, and who takes the key first:
//!
//! * a text field: egui erases with Ctrl+H, Ctrl+U and Ctrl+W on Linux and Windows; on a Mac it erases with
//!   Control+H/K/U/W and walks the caret with Control+A/B/E/F/N/P - a tool there would run while the expression
//!   lost a word or the caret jumped;
//! * the system and the window: on a Mac the application menu winit installs hides the program on Cmd+H and quits
//!   it on Cmd+Q, and macOS itself takes the screenshots (Shift+Cmd+3/4/5), logging out (Shift+Cmd+Q), locking the
//!   screen (Control+Cmd+Q) and the keyboard-navigation keys (Control+F3..F8);
//! * the program's own General keys (`GENERAL`), the same on every system today and listed in each table, so a
//!   system that ever answers them differently changes one table.
//!
//! The keys that cannot carry a binding at all (Space, F1, F2, Enter, Esc, Tab, the arrows - see
//! `Chord::bindable_key`) and Alt (the way from a text field to a bare key) are the program's rules, not a
//! system's, and stay beside the bindings.
