//! FOCUS IN A FIELD DOES NOT TAKE THE KEYBOARD AWAY FROM THE COMMAND.
//!
//! It used to be: `handle_tool_hotkeys` began with an unconditional
//! `if ctx.egui_wants_keyboard_input() { return }`. One line put out ALL 23 tool keys in ALL commands the
//! moment the cursor landed in any input field. The most visible case was reported: in an extrude `U`
//! ("re-pick the contour") could not be pressed until the focus was knocked off with the mouse. And
//! the other half is right there: a second Enter did not apply the command — it never reached it
//! either, and one had to aim at the tick.
//!
//! The rule is now this:
//!
//! * **a bare letter** — when there is no focus in a field (in a field it must be typed: expressions
//!   hold both `w` and `len`);
//! * **Alt plus a letter** — always, including from a field: `egui` does not type it;
//! * **Enter in a field** — accept the value and RELEASE the focus, so that the next Enter applies the
//!   command;
//! * **Esc** — in two steps: first leave the field, and only then cancel the command.
