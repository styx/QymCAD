//! THE STATE OF THE INTERFACE, in a crate of its own.
//!
//! Fifty-five records: the tools with parameters of their own, the selection, the view, the caches, the
//! settings. Every context of a workbench (`PartCtx`, `SketchCtx`, `JointCtx` and the rest) is built out
//! of these and out of nothing else.
//!
//! WHY A CRATE. A workbench cannot become a crate of its own while the records it edits are declared
//! beside the application: it would have to depend on the crate holding the god object, and that is the
//! very dependency the rebuild is undoing. Here they depend on the document, the kernel, the shell and
//! `egui` - which is what the manifest says and a guard below checks.
//!
//! THIS FILE NAMES `App` NOWHERE. That is the whole point, and it is guarded rather than promised.
