//! LOCALISATION: the strings of the interface come from the `i18n/` catalogue built into the binary.
//!
//! The design obeys one requirement: **adding a language = dropping in a catalogue**, without a single
//! edit in the code of the interface. Otherwise outside translations would have to be accepted together
//! with edits to the code, which means they will not be sent.
//!
//! Hence three decisions, each of which closes off a way of spoiling everything:
//!
//! 1. **The list of languages IS BUILT FROM THE CATALOGUE** rather than written by hand. Forgetting to
//!    add a language to the menu is impossible: the menu is the catalogue.
//! 2. **The name of a language lives IN THAT LANGUAGE ITSELF** (the key `language-name`) — "Deutsch",
//!    not "German". Otherwise a table of names would have to be kept in the code, and it would diverge
//!    from the catalogue.
//! 3. **A missing key falls back to English** rather than showing emptiness or the key itself. Without
//!    that, the very first translation at 60% coverage would leave the interface full of holes — and
//!    contributions would become frightening to accept.
//!
//! English is THE REFERENCE: coverage is counted against it and the fallback goes to it. Not because it
//! outranks the rest, but because exactly one reference is needed, otherwise "how complete the
//! translation is" says nothing.
