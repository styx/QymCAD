# Keyboard shortcuts

The full list is “Help -> Keyboard shortcuts”. Keys are reassigned there too.

## General

`Esc` cancels a command, `Enter` applies, `Ctrl+Enter` finishes the sketch, part or subassembly,
`Delete` removes the selection, `F2` renames the selection in the tree, `Ctrl+Z` and `Ctrl+Y` undo and
redo, `Ctrl+S` saves.

These **cannot be reassigned**: they, and every Ctrl combination, belong to the system.

`Ctrl+Enter` goes one level up: out of a sketch into the part, out of a part into the assembly, out of a
subassembly into the assembly holding it. The same as the **Finish** button at the top, without taking your
hands off the keyboard. While a command or an array is open it leaves them alone — there `Enter` applies,
and you leave afterwards.

`F2` opens the name right in the tree row — a part, a subassembly, a sketch, a feature, a body or a
datum. `Enter` confirms the name, `Esc` cancels. With nothing selected, `F2` does nothing.

## Per workbench

Workbench keys are a single letter without modifiers, because the other hand is on the mouse. The
same letter means different things in different workbenches: `C` is a circle in Sketch and a chamfer
in Part. There is no confusion: only one workbench is active at a time.

Part: `E` extrude, `Q` cut, `R` revolve, `F` fillet, `C` chamfer, `H` shell, `O` hole, `M` mirror,
`B` box, `Y` cylinder, `D` datum plane, `K` sketch on a face, `I` measure, `U` reselect the
outline.

Sketch: `L` line, `R` rectangle, `C` circle, `A` arc, `P` point, `G` polygon, `O` slot, `E` ellipse,
`N` spline, `T` text, `D` dimension, `F` corner fillet, `K` trim, `M` mirror, `X` construction, `S`
select.

Assembly: `I` insert, `N` new part, `U` sub-assembly, `J` joint, `D` datum plane.

## When the cursor is in a text field

While the cursor is in a field — the extrusion depth, a name, the search box — **a letter is typed**:
fields take expressions like `w*2`.

To call a tool straight from a field, **hold Alt**: `Alt+U` instead of `U`.

| Where the cursor is | How to call a tool |
| --- | --- |
| in the scene, in the tree, anywhere outside a field | the bare letter: `U` |
| in a text field | `Alt` + the letter: `Alt+U` |

There is no need to click away to free the keyboard.

`Ctrl+K` opens the command search **always**, including from a field. Space does the same, but only
while the cursor is outside a field — inside one it types a space.

## Reassigning

In the reference window click the key of an action, then press the one you want. If it is already
taken in the same workbench, the program says which command has it and asks what to do — see below.

Reassignments are kept in the settings and travel with the profile. **reset** next to a key
returns its default; **Reset every key to the default** returns them all.

Instead of a single key you can press a combination with `Ctrl` or `Shift`: a letter, a digit or
`F3`–`F12` — `W`, `Shift+W`, `Ctrl+Shift+F5`. `Alt` cannot be part of a key: it is what reaches the keys
from a text field. A `Ctrl` combination types nothing, so it works from a text field as it is. On a Mac
`Ctrl` here means `Cmd`, and the window writes the keys the Mac way: `⌘W`, `⇧⌘F5`, `⌥U`. A Mac also takes
combinations with its own `Control` key, `⌃J` or `⌃⌘J`; they work only on a Mac, and on another system the
window shows such a key crossed out. `Esc` while the window waits leaves the key as it was, `Backspace` leaves the
action without a key.

Some combinations cannot be taken. `Ctrl` with `A`, `C`, `K`, `S`, `V`, `X`, `Y` or `Z` — with or without
`Shift` — belongs to every workbench at once: selection, the clipboard, the search, saving, undo. A bare
`X` toggles construction geometry. The rest depends on the system. On Linux and Windows `Ctrl+H`, `Ctrl+U`
and `Ctrl+W` erase text in a field. On a Mac those are free, but `⌘H` hides the program, `⌘Q` quits it,
macOS takes `⇧⌘Q`, `⌃⌘Q`, `⇧⌘3`, `⇧⌘4`, `⇧⌘5` and `⌃F3`–`⌃F8`, and in a field `⌃H`, `⌃K`, `⌃U`, `⌃W` erase
text while `⌃A`, `⌃E`, `⌃B`, `⌃F`, `⌃P`, `⌃N` move the cursor. Hover over a crossed-out key to see why.

When the key is taken, the window offers **Swap** (that command gets the key you are replacing), **Take
it** (that command is left without a key) or **Keep as it was**. The filter above the table finds a command
by a word of its description or by its key.
