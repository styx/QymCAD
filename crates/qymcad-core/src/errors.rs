//! Kernel errors as codes, not as phrases.
//!
//! The core is a library and has no language of its own. While it returned finished prose, two problems
//! followed at once:
//!
//! 1. **The interface could not be translated.** Half of what a person reads at the difficult moment — when a
//!    feature fails to build — came from the core and would have stayed in one language whatever the interface
//!    was set to.
//! 2. **The application told errors apart by substring.** A couple of places matched on a fragment of the
//!    message, which breaks as soon as the wording is edited, and breaks silently: the code compiles, the test
//!    is green, the behaviour is different.
//!
//! The core now names a fact (`CutPlaneDeleted`, `SplitPieceCount { got, want }`) and the application supplies
//! the words in the language of the user. The side benefit outweighs the localisation: errors became
//! programmatically distinguishable and enumerable, so they can be handled rather than guessed at.
//!
//! **Numbers stay inside the error code.** `SplitPieceCount { got: 3, want: 2 }` carries data rather than a
//! finished string: different languages put those numbers in different places in the sentence, and building
//! the text in advance would nail the language down again.
