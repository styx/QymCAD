### Error messages. The core reports a CODE; these are the words for it.
error-thicken-added-nothing = The plate went into the body and added nothing — give the thickness above zero
error-draft-angle-zero = A draft of 0 degrees tilts nothing — give an angle other than zero
error-torus-through-itself = The tube is as thick as the ring or thicker — such a torus passes through itself; make the tube radius smaller than the ring radius
error-array-of-one = A pattern of one copy is the body alone — give two copies or more
### { $name } placeholders carry data from the core — keep them, they are not decoration.

## Operation failed in the geometry kernel.
## The hint in parentheses is the usual cause — it saves a support round-trip.

## Inputs that are missing or stale

error-source-body-not-built = The source body was not built — fix the feature above it first
error-source-body-deleted = What it was built on is deleted — pick another body or delete this feature
error-body-in-pieces = The operation leaves the part in separate pieces — a part is one body; make the addition touch the body, or make a new part
error-body-in-one-piece = The body is one piece — there is no piece to make into a part
error-source-part-has-no-body = The source part has no body
error-body-a-not-built = Body A was not built
error-body-b-not-built = Body B was not built
error-face-not-found = The face is no longer in the source body — the reference went stale
error-faces-not-found = The faces are no longer in the source body — the references went stale
error-profile-not-found = The sketch profile was not found
error-revolve-profile-crosses-axis = The profile crosses the axis of revolution — no CAD can build that. Push the profile against the axis (half a section: a semicircle rather than a circle), or move the axis clear of the profile.
error-sweep-profile-missing = The sweep profile was not found
error-sweep-path-missing = The sweep path was not found
error-no-isolated-points-for-holes = The sketch has no isolated points to place holes at
error-no-points-for-holes = No points to place holes at

## Reference planes

error-cut-plane-deleted = The cutting plane was deleted — pick another one or delete the split
error-sketch-face-gone = The face the sketch stands on is gone: the body it belonged to was deleted. Move the sketch to another face or plane, or undo the deletion
error-sketch-plane-gone = The work plane the sketch stands on was deleted. Move the sketch to another plane or face, or undo the deletion
error-mirror-plane-deleted = The mirror plane was deleted — pick another one or delete the mirror
error-split-plane-deleted = The splitting plane was deleted — pick another one or delete the operation
error-mirror-plane-unset = The mirror plane is not set — recreate the mirrored part
error-zero-normal = The plane normal is zero — no direction is defined

## Values that make no sense

error-zero-thickness = Zero thickness — there would be no plate
error-zero-push-distance = Zero distance — there is nowhere to move the face
error-broken-solid = The kernel returned an unusable solid — the operation was cancelled and the part is unchanged. This usually happens when the face borders a fillet or chamfer: try a smaller distance, or move the operation before the fillet in the timeline
error-split-piece-count = The plane now cuts the body into { $got } parts instead of { $want } — move the plane back or recreate the split
error-loft-needs-two-sections = A loft needs at least two closed sections
error-draft-needs-faces = A draft needs the faces to tilt and a neutral face
error-no-contours = No contours for the operation
error-all-edges-smooth = Every selected edge is a smooth joint (a fillet boundary) — there is nothing to round or chamfer
error-fillet-radius-too-big = Fillet R{ $radius } did not take on: { $issues }{ $smooth }
# One edge in that list. «takes up to» tells the user the largest radius that WOULD work.
error-fillet-edge-takes-up-to = edge { $edge } (takes up to { $max })
error-fillet-edge-takes-none = edge { $edge } (takes no radius at all — it runs into a tangent joint of an earlier fillet; remove this edge or round its neighbour first)
error-fillet-smooth-skipped = ; { $n } smooth joints were skipped automatically
error-fillet-edges-one-by-one = Fillet R{ $radius }: these edges only take one at a time — neighbouring fillets overlap
error-chamfer-too-big = Chamfer { $dist } mm failed — the leg is larger than the side
error-surface-does-not-close = The surface does not match the opening: { $n } edges are left unpaired. The boundaries differ — build the patch on the same edges that bound the face being replaced
error-push-face-on-sheet = A surface face cannot be pushed: this is a solid operation. To give a surface thickness, use "Thicken"
error-needs-solid-not-sheet = This is a solid tool: it does not apply to a surface. Give the surface a thickness and work with it as an ordinary body
error-draft-failed = A draft of { $angle }° will not take on these faces. Usually a thin wall is in the way: after a shell there is little left to slope — apply the draft before the shell, or use a smaller angle

## Threads and augers

error-thread-rim-not-found = The cylinder or hole rim (a circular edge) was not found
error-thread-length-unset = The thread length is not set
error-thread-pitch-too-small = Pitch { $pitch } mm is too small
error-thread-too-many-turns = { $turns } turns is too many — increase the pitch or shorten the thread
error-thread-longer-than-face = A thread { $length } mm long is longer than the cylinder ({ $face } mm). Shorten the thread
error-thread-depth-too-deep = Thread depth { $depth } mm is at or beyond the radius { $radius } mm: for Ø{ $dia } the pitch { $pitch } is too coarse
error-thread-not-its-size = A thread of Ø{ $nominal } does not fit a face of Ø{ $face } — choose the size of the face, or the face of the size
warn-edges-dropped = { $dropped } of the { $asked } edges could not be taken and are left sharp; the rest are done — double-click the node to pick other edges or another size
error-thread-removed-nothing = The thread removed nothing ({ $before } -> { $after } mm³) — check the chosen face, pitch and length
error-thread-failed = The thread did not build (check pitch, length and diameter)
error-auger-rim-not-found = The shaft rim (a circular edge) was not found
error-auger-bad-pitch-or-length = Auger pitch and length must both be greater than zero
error-auger-outer-not-bigger = Auger outer Ø{ $outer } is not larger than the shaft Ø{ $shaft }
error-auger-added-nothing = The auger flight added nothing ({ $before } -> { $after } mm³) — check the outer Ø and the chosen shaft
error-auger-flight-failed = The auger flight did not build (check pitch, thickness and outer diameter)

## Isolation: a part owns its geometry

error-body-only-in-part = A body can only be built inside a Part (an Assembly does not hold bodies)
error-cross-component-input = Cross-component reference is not allowed: input { $input } belongs to another component
error-sketch-on-foreign-face = Sketch input { $input } sits on a face of another component's body without an external reference
error-sketch-face-ref-lost = The sketch face reference on body { $body } was not found by name after the rebuild — the closest match was used, so check where the feature landed

## Results that are empty

error-array-empty = The pattern produced nothing
error-empty-result = The result is an empty body
error-remove-faces-failed = The faces cannot be removed: { $why }

## Assembly

## Expressions

error-expr-unknown-char = Unknown character «{ $what }»
error-expr-unknown-fn = Unknown function «{ $what }»
error-expr-unknown-name = unknown name: { $what } — there is no such parameter
error-expr-needs-one-arg = { $what }() takes one argument

error-expr-expected-paren = Expected «)»
error-expr-expected-paren-after-args = Expected «)» after the arguments

error-expr-unexpected-end = the expression ends too early: a number or a name was expected
error-expr-trailing-input = Trailing input at «{ $what }»
error-expr-not-a-number = The result is not a number (division by zero?)

io-file-replace = could not replace { $v }
io-file-read = could not read { $v }
